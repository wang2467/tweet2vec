# tweet2vec
The goal of this project is to reproduce the implementaion in paper Tweet2vec: Character-Based Distributed Representation for Social Meida.

10/20: The first step is to test the bi-directional GRU model on stackoverflow text classification. The label_stackoverflow.txt file contains 20000 short texts where each with the length of within 200 characters. The size of the labels is 20. It is hard to get a large collection of global Twitter posts with uniformly distributed topics, due to the low rate limit of the Twitter search API. But I won't give up!
